## Java Project: Vending Machine System (Version 1.0)

### Topic Choice

I chose to implement a Vending Machine System because it offers an interesting combination of object-oriented programming and user interaction. It provides opportunities to use matrices for product storage, arrays for tracking prices, and an interactive menu for user actions.

### Implementation Overview

#### Classes

1. **VendingMachine**
   - Manages the product grid (matrix)
   - Handles selection and restocking
2. **Item**
   - Represents individual products with name and price

#### Interactive Menu

The program presents a menu with options to:

1. Buy a product
2. Restock the vending machine
3. Display available Products
4. Exit the program

#### Control Flow

Control structures used include:

- `if-else` for input validation
- `switch-case` for menu selection
- `for` loops for matrix operations

### Challenges Faced

1. **Issues with merging the branches:**

## Java Project: Vending Machine System (Version 1.2) - Enhanced 

## New Features

### Product Code Selection for Purchases
- **Added Product Code Input:** Users can now select products by entering a product code (1-9). The code corresponds to a specific product in the vending machine.
- **Product Layout Display:** The vending machine now shows the product codes along with names and prices for easy reference.
- **Code Validation:** When a user enters a product code, the machine validates the input and displays the selected product along with its price.
- **Improved Purchase Flow:** After selecting a product code, users are prompted to choose a payment method and can complete the purchase.
  
### Example:
When the user views the vending machine layout, it will show:
